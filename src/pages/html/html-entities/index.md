## HTML Entities

HTML emtites are a way to print some special characters, and be sure they will be display correctly, no matter what the charater encoding will be used either to create the HTML file itself, or to display the page on the client browser. Moreover that's a convenient way to put some invisible or not visually distinctive characters, like non-breaking space, N- or M-dash, exactly upper or lower quotes etc. It also gives an ability to display any character you need as long as you know its number in Unicode characters chart.

An entity in HTML is encoded with ampersand, entity code/name and a semicolon. Like &ndash; (name) or &#x02013; (hex-code) or
&#8211; (decimal code) - these three variants encode the same N-dash symbol.
