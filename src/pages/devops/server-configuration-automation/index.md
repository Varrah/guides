Managing several dozens of servers can be troublesome. Imagine you need to update cron-scripts on 10 machines adding couple of lines depending on the machine name. In earlier years, you'd SSH to each server, run sudo crontab and copy and paste some template lines and then alter them for each server. Looks pretty dull, right? Now imagine you need not only alter the crontab, but also update some packets, some more config, etc. 

Here come the server configuration management tools, that can do this for you. They will give you a way (usually file-and-folder-tree) to edit all of your configs for each server, substitue some server-related variables, add (and read later!) comments on all the changes you (or your fellow collegues) did to a config, and then just automatically apply all such changes to all of your servers at once, minding all of the proper services restarts and othe special scripts and procedures.
